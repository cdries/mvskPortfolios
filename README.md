# mvskPortfolios
Higher moment efficient portfolios


This R package implements the MVSK portfolio tilting framework presented in the paper:

Boudt, Cornilly, Van Holle and Willems (2020). Algorithmic portfolio tilting to harvest higher moment gains. Heliyon, 6(3). (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e03516)

Installing the developer version of the package is possible by

```
devtools::install_github("cdries/mvskPortfolios")
